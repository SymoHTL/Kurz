# 19. Actors

An actor is an object with private state and an inbox, which handles one message at a time; a call
of its method through its reference is a message (§6, "Actors"). This chapter holds the actors of
one machine and what a program writes of them: an actor's declaration, `spawn`, the call that waits
for its result, `send`, and what crosses into a message. The scheduler, the stacks, crashes and
supervision, deadlocks, the clauses after an actor's name and the actors of other machines (§6, §7)
have no rule here, and `compiler/README.md` says what the compiler builds of the rules here.

### U1 (decided, §6) `actor`, and its words

`actor Name(Type Field, ...) { ... }` declares an actor, with a primary constructor and a body as a
class has them (K1, K7), whose fields nothing outside the actor reaches (U8) (§6, "An actor is an
object with private state"). `actor`, `spawn` and `send` are core words, so that none of them names
a variable, a function or a type (L18), and the clauses after an actor's name, `per`, `yield`,
`inbox`, the stack's size and `on crash`, stand before its body in any order, their words words
only there (§6, the owner, 2026-11-13, #519, comment 6847932993, Q10, "Any order + contextual
(Recommended)").

Case: [actors/counter.kz](../corpus/actors/counter.kz)
```kurz
actor Counter {
    mut int count = 0

    pub void Add(int n) {
        count = count + n
    }

    pub int Get() => count
}

c = spawn Counter()
send c.Add(1)
send c.Add(2)
print(c.Get())
```

Case: [actors/spawn-reserved-word.kz](../corpus/actors/spawn-reserved-word.kz)
```kurz
spawn = 1
print(spawn)
```

### U2 (decided, §6) `spawn`

`spawn Name(args)` makes an actor, its arguments bound to its primary constructor as a class's
construction binds them (K1, D11), and gives its reference, a value of the type `Name`; each `spawn`
makes an actor with a state of its own. An actor's constructor is its primary one, and a call of an
actor's name without `spawn` is the compile error `spawn-required` (§6, the owner, 2026-11-13, #519,
comment 6847932993, Q13, "Primary ctor, kept args (Recommended)"). What `==`, a hash and the text of
an actor's reference are stands open (§14), asked on issue 519 (comment 6866132292, Q10).

Case: [actors/two-instances.kz](../corpus/actors/two-instances.kz)
```kurz
actor Counter {
    mut int count = 0

    pub void Add(int n) {
        count = count + n
    }

    pub int Get() => count
}

a = spawn Counter()
b = spawn Counter()
send a.Add(1)
send b.Add(2)
print(a.Get())
print(b.Get())
```

Case: [actors/constructor-arguments.kz](../corpus/actors/constructor-arguments.kz)
```kurz
int Made(int n) {
    print("made {n}")
    return n
}

actor Account(int Start) {
    mut int balance = Made(Start)

    pub void Deposit(int n) {
        balance = balance + n
    }

    pub int Balance() => balance
}

a = spawn Account(10)
print("spawned")
send a.Deposit(5)
print(a.Balance())
```

    int count = 0

    pub int Get() => count
}

c = Counter()
print(c.Get())
```

Case: [actors/counter.kz](../corpus/actors/counter.kz)

### U3 (assumed, §6) The constructor runs while the spawner waits

An actor's constructor, its fields' defaults with it, runs in the new actor while the code that
spawned it waits, as Elixir's `GenServer.start_link` waits for `init/1`, so that on one machine what
the constructor prints comes before what the spawner prints after its `spawn` *(assumed: that
reading, the lean of the round of 2026-11-13, issue 519, comment 6866132292, Q2, which no answer
named)*.

Case: [actors/constructor-arguments.kz](../corpus/actors/constructor-arguments.kz)

### U4 (decided, §5, §6) A call through a reference waits

A call of an actor's `pub` method through its reference, `c.Get()`, is a message, and its caller
waits for its result (§6, "A call waits for its result by default"). The result is read as any
call's: its success is the value, and its other cases leave the calling code or are handled, as O2
to O5 say (§5).

Case: [actors/union-result.kz](../corpus/actors/union-result.kz)
```kurz
data NotFound

actor Store {
    pub int | NotFound Find(int id) {
        if id == 1 {
            return 10
        }
        return NotFound
    }
}

s = spawn Store()
value = s.Find(1) else {
    NotFound => 0
}
print(value)
match s.Find(2) {
    int n => print(n)
    NotFound => print("none")
}
```

### U5 (assumed, §6) The order of one sender's messages

Messages from one actor to another arrive in the order they were sent, the top-level code among the
actors, as the root actor (§6, *(assumed)* there).

Case: [actors/send-order.kz](../corpus/actors/send-order.kz)
```kurz
actor Printer {
    pub void Show(int n) {
        print(n)
    }

    pub string Done() => "done"
}

p = spawn Printer()
send p.Show(1)
send p.Show(2)
send p.Show(3)
print(p.Done())
```

Case: [actors/own-method-direct.kz](../corpus/actors/own-method-direct.kz)
```kurz
actor Doubler {
    mut int total = 0

    pub void Add(int n) {
        total = total + Twice(n)
    }

    int Twice(int n) => n * 2

    pub int Total() => this.total
}

d = spawn Doubler()
send d.Add(1)
send d.Add(2)
print(d.Total())
```

Case: [actors/constructor-arguments.kz](../corpus/actors/constructor-arguments.kz)

### U6 (decided, §6) `send`

`send` before a call of an actor's method, `send c.Add(1)`, makes the call a message that nobody
waits for (§6, "`send` makes a call fire-and-forget"). A `send` of a method that gives a result is
the compile error `send-result`, since its result and its cases would reach nobody (§6, the owner,
2026-11-13, #519, comment 6847932993, Q12, "send-result error (Recommended)").

Case: [actors/send-result.kz](../corpus/actors/send-result.kz)
```kurz
actor Counter {
    int count = 0

    pub int Get() => count
}

c = spawn Counter()
send c.Get()
```

Case: [actors/counter.kz](../corpus/actors/counter.kz)

Case: [actors/send-order.kz](../corpus/actors/send-order.kz)

Case: [actors/relay.kz](../corpus/actors/relay.kz)
```kurz
actor Printer {
    mut int last = 0

    pub void Show(int n) {
        print("relayed {n}")
        last = n
    }

    pub int Last() => last
}

actor Relay(Printer Target) {
    pub void Pass(int n) {
        send Target.Show(n)
    }
}

p = spawn Printer()
r = spawn Relay(p)
r.Pass(7)
print(p.Last())
```

### U7 (assumed, §6) A `void` with cases gives a result

A method whose success is `void` with cases beside it, `void | Full`, gives a result, so that its
`send` is `send-result`, since its cases would reach nobody (§6, *(assumed)* there, of Q12).

Case: [actors/send-void-or-error.kz](../corpus/actors/send-void-or-error.kz)
```kurz
data Full

actor Store {
    mut int count = 0

    pub void | Full Add() {
        if count == 3 {
            return Full
        }
        count = count + 1
    }
}

s = spawn Store()
send s.Add()
```

### U8 (decided, §6) Its fields are its own

Nothing outside an actor reaches its fields (§6, "Nobody outside can touch its fields"): a read or
an assignment of one through a reference is the compile error `not-visible` *(proposed: F9's id,
which section 6 does not name)*. Whether a `pub` field or a property of an actor is a compile error,
a read that waits, or allowed and never visible stands open, asked on issue 519 (comment 6866132292,
Q4).

Case: [actors/field-not-visible.kz](../corpus/actors/field-not-visible.kz)
```kurz
actor Counter {
    int count = 0

    pub int Get() => count
}

c = spawn Counter()
print(c.count)
```

### U9 (proposed) A message calls a `pub` method

A method called through an actor's reference has `pub`, and a call of one without it is
`not-visible`, as F9 makes a method without `pub` private to its class: section 6 makes a call on an
actor look like an ordinary method call and says nothing of its visibility. What a `mut` parameter
of a method called through a reference is stands open, asked on issue 519 (comment 6866132292, Q6).

Case: [actors/private-method.kz](../corpus/actors/private-method.kz)
```kurz
actor Counter {
    int count = 0

    int Get() => count
}

c = spawn Counter()
print(c.Get())
```

### U10 (decided, §6) Inside, its own members are direct

Inside an actor its own fields and methods are reached as a class's are, by their names or through
`this` (K7), and a call of its own method is a direct call and no message (§6, the owner,
2026-11-13, #519, comment 6847932993, Q14, "Direct call (Recommended)"). What `this` is as a value
inside an actor stands open, asked on issue 519 (comment 6866132292, Q7).

Case: [actors/own-method-direct.kz](../corpus/actors/own-method-direct.kz)

### U11 (assumed, §6) `send` of its own method

`send` of an actor's own method inside it, `send Second()` or `send this.Second()`, is a message
queued behind the one that runs, as Akka's `self ! m` and Elixir's `GenServer.cast(self(), ...)`
are *(assumed: that reading, the lean of the round of 2026-11-13, issue 519, comment 6866132292,
Q5, which no answer named)*.

Case: [actors/send-own-method.kz](../corpus/actors/send-own-method.kz)
```kurz
actor Worker {
    pub void Start() {
        send Second()
        print("first")
    }

    pub void Second() {
        print("second")
    }

    pub void Done() {
        print("done")
    }
}

w = spawn Worker()
w.Start()
w.Done()
```

### U12 (decided, §6) What crosses

What crosses between actors is a value (`data`, a collection, a string, a number), an immutable
class instance and an actor's reference; a mutable class instance crosses with `copy` or `move`
alone (§6, "What may cross between actors"). A message's arguments and its result cross so, and so
do the arguments of an actor's constructor, which cross as a call's do (§6, the owner,
2026-11-13, #519, comment 6847932993, Q13).

Case: [actors/relay.kz](../corpus/actors/relay.kz)

Case: [actors/union-result.kz](../corpus/actors/union-result.kz)

### U13 (assumed, §6) The end of the program drops what is queued

When the top-level code ends, a message that runs in an actor it spawned runs to its end, and the
messages still queued behind it are dropped, since the end of the root actor stops its children
after their current message (§6, the owner, 2026-11-13, #519, comment 6847932993, Q16) *(assumed: that reading, the lean of the round of
2026-11-13, issue 519, comment 6866132292, Q8, which no answer named)*.

No case: which message runs when the top-level code ends is the scheduler's to say where actors run
on more than one thread, so that a case's output would hang on it.

### U14 (proposed) `spawn` and `send` before what is not theirs

`spawn` before a name that is no actor is `type-mismatch`, and `send` before what is no call of an
actor's method is `syntax` (E4), as Rust gives a type error (E0277) for a value that is not what
`tokio::spawn` takes: section 6 names neither id *(proposed: the lean of the round of 2026-11-13,
issue 519, comment 6866132292, Q3, which no answer named)*.

Case: [actors/spawn-not-actor.kz](../corpus/actors/spawn-not-actor.kz)
```kurz
class Box(int Size)

b = spawn Box(1)
print(b.Size)
```

Case: [actors/send-not-call.kz](../corpus/actors/send-not-call.kz)
```kurz
void Show(int n) {
    print(n)
}

send Show(1)
```

### U15 (proposed) A message sent inside a message

On one machine, a message that an actor sends while it runs a message stands in its receiver's
inbox before every message that the caller of the running one sends after its call returned, as a
queue keeps the order in which its items were put in: U5 holds the order of one sender's messages,
and section 6 says nothing of two senders'.
